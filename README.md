Welcome to our final ecommerce project!

This project is an ecommerce web application built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process. It also includes an admin panel where administrators can manage products and orders.

To get started, you will need to install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine. Once you have done that, clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/final-ecommerce-project.git
cd final-ecommerce-project
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and the client simultaneously. The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` and the client on `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now start using the ecommerce application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

We hope you enjoy working with our final ecommerce project and learn a lot from it. Happy coding!
